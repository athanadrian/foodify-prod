            At the end of November my wife with her business partners and I
            visited the restaurant "<span className='important'>title...</span>"
            to have our "<span className='important'>dinner...</span>". It was
            located at the "<span className='important'>village...</span>". It
            is built in the style of a huntsman's hut. This restaurant was
            chosen for its unique "<span className='important'>cuisine...</span>
            " that can satisfy the guests and for its quiet setting where we
            could have a conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, the "<span className='important'>menu...</span>" itself
            surprised our guests â€“ it looked like a newspaper and no one guessed
            to look at it. Several newspapers were lying at our tables not
            catching our attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            The uniqueness of the restaurant lies in that you end up having an
            excellent "<span className='important'>dinner...</span>" without
            having to spend a large amount of money cause the "
            <span className='important'>cost...</span>" is "
            <span className='important'>average...</span>"
          </p>
